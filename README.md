# Restaurant Resevation System

For this project, I was tasked with creatin a website built around a MVC base. It should ask the user to input data and be able to add that data to a database. 

I decided to create restaurant resevation website that allows you to book a reservation, pick what date, time and how many people you will bring. My goal was to create a easy-to-use website with a simple booking system. While I feel like I achieved this. I had some serious issues in regards to actual functionality.

### CSS problem with Heroku deployment

The first problem I ran into was that I was unable to get my heroku hosted website to apply my style.css file despite it being applied when being run on a local server within the IDE. The error code in question is as followed,

"Refused to apply style from 'https://sean-reservation-app.herokuapp.com/static/css/style.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled."

Despite multiple attemped fixes, I was unable to solve the issue.

### Adding data from reservation.html

The second problem I ran into was that I was unable to get the data entered by the user added to the database. As admin, I was able to enter the relevent data and add reservation for a time. However, as of right now, it does not work.

## Conclusion

I am very dissapointed with how this project turned out for the simple reason that the website, at time of submission, does not work. There is clearly lots to improve on before I undoubtably have to redo this project
